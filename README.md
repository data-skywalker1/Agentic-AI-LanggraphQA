# Agentic-AI-LanggraphQA
Agentic-AI-LanggraphQA

A small collection of example notebooks and scripts that demonstrate simple LLM workflows using LangGraph, LangChain, and Google GenAI. The repo is for experimentation and learning.

Contents
- Example notebooks (`*.ipynb`) demonstrating prompt-chaining and workflow patterns.
- Minimal chatbot examples (`chatbot_backend.py`, `chatbot_frontend.py`) — includes a Streamlit frontend for the demo.
- `requirements.txt` listing required Python packages.

Quick start (high level)
1. Activate your Python environment (or use the provided `./langgraph` venv).
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Add any required API keys to a `.env` file and restart your Jupyter kernel.

See the notebooks for runnable examples and usage notes.

If you need a more detailed setup or troubleshooting steps, ask and I can expand this README.
