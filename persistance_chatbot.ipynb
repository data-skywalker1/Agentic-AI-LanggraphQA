      "1.  **\"How do you know when a politician is lying?\" \"Their lips are moving.\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This is a classic piece of hyperbole. It humorously exaggerates the widespread perception that politicians are inherently dishonest and lie constantly. The joke implies that anything a politician says is likely a lie, simply by virtue of them speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **\"What's the difference between a politician and a baby?\" \"Eventually, you can reason with the baby.\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This joke uses an unflattering comparison. It suggests that politicians, despite being adults, are unreasonable, stubborn, and impervious to logic, facts, or the concerns of the public. A baby, though initially irrational, will eventually develop the capacity for reason, implying politicians *never* will.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **A politician, a lawyer, and an honest man walk into a bar. The bartender looks up and says, \"Hey, an honest man! What can I get you?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This joke plays on negative stereotypes associated with both politicians and lawyers, who are often perceived as dishonest or manipulative. The humor comes from the bartender's surprise and immediate attention to the \"honest man,\" implying that the politician and lawyer are, by default, *not* honest, making the \"honest man\" a rare and noteworthy presence in that company.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **\"Why do politicians always talk about the future?\" \"Because it's easier to promise things that way.\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This joke critiques a common political tactic. Politicians often make grand promises during campaigns or speeches about what they *will* do in the future. The humor lies in the cynical implication that these promises are often empty or impossible to fulfill, but by placing them in the future, politicians are less accountable for their immediate delivery. It suggests they use \"the future\" as a safe space for making pledges without immediate repercussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Politics is like a treadmill. You exert a lot of energy, feel like you're going somewhere, but ultimately end up in the same place.**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This is an analogy that expresses frustration and a sense of futility with the political process. The \"exert a lot of energy\" refers to all the campaigning, debates, policy changes, and public discourse. \"Feel like you're going somewhere\" captures the hope and belief in progress. \"Ultimately end up in the same place\" is the punchline, suggesting that despite all the effort and changes, fundamental problems persist, society doesn't truly advance, or things revert to an earlier state, leaving people feeling stagnant.\n",
      "\n",
